todo (07/04/2019)

future:
- explore crossvalidation, gridsearch/gradient descent etc. (loss functions)
- explore person-based models? -> maybe after picking a main method... (SVM?)
- review lectures ML1
- explore bootstrapping
- evaluation
- parameter tuning
- produce many more visuals of loss steps etc., maybe loss surfaces 
- could i maybe predict the first few values for each person (except the first)? generate SOME prediction?
